Task:
CT datasets can be very large. 10GB is not uncommon. Of course there is a limit to what we can import or load in the memory and probably also to what openGL can render. I would like you to investigate how we can:
1) prevent user from loading datsets which are bigger than the systems free memory capacity. 
2) how we can reduce the import data size (eg cropping or binning at import stage, U8/U16 variables for the volume.

The output format is a plan.
