Task implement the acquila_zmq client in 3dviewer.

acquila_zmq can be found on github: https://github.com/bmasscha/acquila_zmq.git

1) study how the library works. 
2) look at the client example
3) uninstall the library acquila_zmq. use the python and pip version in the venv.
4) get the library acquila_zmq from github and install it in the 3dviewer venv. 
5) we will make a new command processor that tries to execute commands which come in via the ZMQ tunnel. The acquila_zmq library may not be altered. It is the 3dviewer command processing which needs to be standardized to the acquila json format. 
6) commands will always be in the same format like 3dviewer COMMAND ARG reply_type (see documentation). Thus in the command processor we have to translate which events we have to trigger to realize what the command is expecting.
7) Make a list of all possible commands and arguments that we will accept from the ZMQ tunnel (eg load_data;path, set_transfer_function;rainbow, set_rendering_mode;MIP ...)
8) Start by making a plan of how we will approach this task
