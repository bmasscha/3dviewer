Task add 3d noise filter to the 3dviewer

Always work in the 3dviewer venv
Investigate possible candidates for a 3d noise filter
Select two candidates and implement them in the 3dviewer
Present the noise filter to the user in the GUI of the 3dviewer. Allow the user to select the noise filter and apply it to the 3d volume.

Make a plan of how we will approach this task: Which libraries are necessary? Is this to be done on the gpu or on the cpu? Once filtered, there is no way back to the original data, or not?
